# 🐍 Snake Game 🍎

Welcome to the classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎮 

## 📋 Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the popular Snake Game. The objective is to control the snake, guiding it to eat the apples while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. The game becomes increasingly challenging as the snake grows longer with each apple eaten. 🍏

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Controls**: 
    - Use arrow keys (Up ⬆️, Down ⬇️, Left ⬅️, Right ➡️) to control the direction of the snake.
2. **Objective**: 
    - Eat as many apples as possible without colliding with walls or yourself.
3. **Game Over**: 
    - The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself. Your score will be displayed.
